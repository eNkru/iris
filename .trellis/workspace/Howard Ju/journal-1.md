## Session 1: Implement price tracker full-stack app

**Date**: 2026-08-01
**Task**: Implement price tracker full-stack app
**Branch**: `main`

### Summary

Implemented the price tracking & alert app end-to-end: 6-workspace monorepo (Next.js 15 + oRPC + Drizzle + better-auth + Vercel AI SDK), AI price-extraction pipeline, scheduler with Redis distributed lock, Telegram-first alert channel registry, web UI (login/products/settings), Docker Compose deployment. All quality gates passed (typecheck/lint/build). Updated .trellis specs with lessons: better-auth user.id is text not uuid, Drizzle numeric coercion, oRPC FetchHandler mount, instrumentation edge-runtime guard.

## Session 2: Fix Playwright deployment: module resolution + glibc Docker base

**Date**: 2026-08-03
**Task**: Fix Playwright deployment: module resolution + glibc Docker base
**Branch**: `feat/playwright-page-fetch`

### Summary

Fixed two deployment bugs preventing Playwright from running in Docker: (1) the custom ignorePlaywrightPlugin in next.config.ts was generating a throw stub instead of externalizing the module — removed it and relied on serverExternalPackages; (2) node:22-alpine (musl) cannot run Playwright's glibc-linked chromium binary — switched to node:22-bookworm-slim with playwright install --with-deps. Also added playwright to apps/web/package.json for runtime module resolution. Updated the performance spec to reflect the Playwright architecture.

## Session 3: Generic OpenAI-compatible AI config

**Date**: 2026-08-04
**Task**: Generic OpenAI-compatible AI config
**Branch**: `main`

### Summary

Replaced the 4-way AI provider enum (openai/gemini/anthropic/opencode) + per-provider SDK switch with a single generic OpenAI-compatible config (base URL + API key + model), all admin-editable in global_settings (key masked on read) with env fallbacks. Collapsed the 3 migrations into a single 0000_initial baseline. Unified the extraction pipeline on generateText + fetchPage tool (no generateObject branch). Fixed a schema-validation crash where DeepSeek's available:false + null price/name responses were rejected — priceExtractionSchema is now a discriminated union on available. Removed @ai-sdk/openai/google/anthropic deps. Updated .env.example, docker-compose, next.config, and the ai-sdk-integration spec. PR #4 merged to main. Also brainstormed (not yet implemented) a follow-up anti-bot-waf-bypass task for Akamai-protected retailers (Farmers serves a WAF deny page to headless Chromium).

**Date**: 2026-08-04
**Task**: Anti-bot WAF detection (Farmers / Akamai)
**Branch**: `feat/anti-bot-waf-detection`

### Summary

Shipped detection-only anti-bot WAF handling for the price pipeline after two Farmers spike rounds failed free/local stealth. Added blocked-signatures (akamai-waf, access-denied, behavioral-challenge), short-circuit in checkPrice, performance.md update, branch/PR #5, archived 08-04-anti-bot-waf-bypass.

## Session 5: Camoufox-only fetch transport (hard anti-bot bypass)

**Date**: 2026-08-05
**Task**: Camoufox-only fetch transport (hard anti-bot bypass)
**Branch**: `main`

### Summary

Replaced Playwright Chromium with a required Camoufox sidecar as the single page-fetch transport so DataDome (kogan), Cloudflare managed (noelleeming), and Akamai (farmers) PDPs can be added. Extended blocked-signatures for DataDome/Cloudflare (tightened to avoid Turnstile false positives on pbtech), rewrote fetch-page as a sidecar HTTP client with ok/blocked/null results, switched checkPrice AI extract to preloaded HTML (single generateText) to avoid DeepSeek multi-step reasoning_content failures, removed Playwright from the app image, and shipped camoufox/ + compose wiring. PR #6 merged to main.

## Session 6: Frontend UX/UI review fixes

**Date**: 2026-08-05
**Task**: Frontend UX/UI review fixes
**Branch**: `main`

### Summary

Applied the 2026-08-05 UX/UI review of the Iris web app (apps/web), pure-frontend. Fixed misleading states: per-row pending action state in the product list (R1), inline check-now error on product detail (R2), silent alert-config warning (R3). UX gaps: Paused badge + muted styling (R4), inline delete confirm replacing window.confirm (R5), relative last-checked times + 30s auto-refresh (R6), Telegram chat-id guidance (R7), transient 3s 'Saved.' feedback on all three settings forms (R8). Polish/a11y: Intl.NumberFormat formatPrice with try/catch fallback (R9), new dependency-free SegmentedControl for chart range (R10), chart currency context (R11), focus-visible rings on buttons + nav links (R12), detail title falls back to URL (R13), login copy + spam hint + resend path (R14), app/icon.svg favicon (R15). All AC1-AC16 pass; typecheck + lint clean. Updated frontend specs with transient-feedback and per-row-pending patterns.

## Session: Send product summary to Telegram from UI

**Date**: 2026-08-06
**Task**: 08-05-send-summary-to-telegram
**Branch**: `main`

### Summary

Added a "Send summary to Telegram" button to the Products page that dispatches a summary of all tracked products (active + paused) to the user's enabled Telegram channel(s). Refactored `packages/prices/src/notifications/telegram.ts` to extract the low-level `sendTelegramText(chatId, text, meta?)` sender (token resolution, p-limit, 10s timeout, error-swallowing, structured logging, `parse_mode: HTML` with plain-text 400 retry); added `format.ts` escaping/grouping helpers (`escapeTelegramHtml`, `formatTelegramLink`, `formatPriceGrouped`); added `summary.ts` (`formatProductSummaryMessage`, `formatRelativeTime`, `sendProductSummary`); new oRPC `channels.sendSummary` (POST /channels/summary, PRECONDITION_FAILED on no channel); `useSendSummary()` hook + button + SuccessBox/ErrorBox in product-list.tsx; shared `TelegramHelpTooltip` setup guidance. All typecheck/lint/build green.

### Main Changes

- Backend: telegram.ts extraction, format.ts HTML helpers, summary.ts module, channels sendSummary procedure + schema + router.
- Frontend: useSendSummary hook, product-list button + transient feedback, telegram-help-tooltip.tsx.
- Spec: added `.trellis/spec/backend/notifications-telegram.md` executable contracts + index entry.

## Session: Dark/light mode + en/zh internationalization

**Date**: 2026-08-06
**Task**: 08-06-theme-and-i18n
**Branch**: `main`

### Summary

Added class-based dark/light theme and en/zh UI + notification localization. Theme: `ThemeProvider`/`useTheme` (localStorage `iris.theme`, `.dark` class toggled on `<html>`, follows OS `prefers-color-scheme` when no stored choice, live OS changes) + `ThemeToggle` segmented control. i18n: dependency-free typed dictionaries in `lib/dictionary.ts` (`type Lang = "en" | "zh"`, `DictKey` derived from the `en` dict so a missing `zh` key is a compile-time error), `t(lang, key, vars?)` interpolation, client `LanguageProvider`/`useI18n` (localStorage `iris.lang` + `iris.lang` cookie), server `getLang()` cookie helper, `<html lang>` set. Localized app nav, pages, forms, lists, and settings sections. Backend: `formatPriceAlertMessage`/`formatProductSummaryMessage`/`formatRelativeTime` now take `lang: Language = "en"`; `sendProductSummary` groups channels by `alert_channels.config.language`, building one message per language and sending via `Promise.all` (no await-in-loop); channel create/update validate optional `language` via `languageZodSchema` (`LANGUAGE_VALUES = ["en","zh"]` in `@iris/utils`). Chart colors moved to `--chart-*` CSS variables defined in `:root` + `.dark` so Recharts stays visible in dark mode. Dispatched implement + check sub-agents. All typecheck/lint/build green.

### Main Changes

- Frontend: theme.tsx, i18n.tsx, dictionary.ts, theme-toggle.tsx, language-toggle.tsx, app/lib/get-lang.ts, providers wiring.
- Backend: localized formatters + per-language summary batching, channels create/update `language` validation.
- Spec: updated `.trellis/spec/backend/notifications-telegram.md` (lang contracts, batching, backward-compatible default), `.trellis/spec/frontend/state-management.md` (i18n context convention), `.trellis/spec/frontend/css-layout.md` (dark-mode vars + chart vars), index descriptions.

## Session 7: Camoufox sidecar diagnostic logging

**Date**: 2026-08-07
**Task**: Camoufox sidecar diagnostic logging
**Branch**: `camoufox-sidecar-diagnose`

### Summary

Added structured diagnostic logging to camoufox/server.py to capture the real page.goto failure when the shared browser degrades after hours of uptime: qualified exception class name (error_type) on every failure path, previously-silent response-is-None path now logged, module-level consecutive-failure counter with reset-on-success, and one rich 'browser degraded' summary (repr+traceback) at DIAGNOSE_THRESHOLD=3. Logging-only — no recreation/lock/teardown (self-heal task's scope); /v1/fetch and /health responses byte-identical. Spec updated in backend/performance.md.

## Session 8: SPA price extraction: wait for JS-rendered content

**Date**: 2026-08-07
**Task**: SPA price extraction: wait for JS-rendered content
**Branch**: `spa-price-extraction`

### Summary

Root-caused woolworths create-rollback (status=unavailable): Angular SPA injects price after domcontentloaded, so page.content() snapped an empty shell and the AI reported available:false. networkidle experimentally still returned 0 body text. Added a generic content-stabilization wait in camoufox/server.py (RENDER_WAIT_SECONDS=8, RENDER_MIN_TEXT_LEN=200 floor to avoid chrome-stub false-stabilize, RENDER_STABLE_SECONDS=1). E2E: SPA PDP returns ok:true with product name + $39.99; paknsave still extracts. Spec updated in backend/performance.md. No host branching, no API change.

## Session 9: Finish UI professional polish + repo/issues links

**Date**: 2026-08-08
**Task**: Finish UI professional polish + repo/issues links
**Branch**: `main`

### Summary

Completed the Professional UI polish task: heavier visual redesign (AppShell with sticky nav + bottom footer, PageHeader pattern, Card/Badge/StatusPill primitives, calmer slate surfaces + subtle cool accent tokens in light+dark), dependency-free monogram brand mark, and app footer with i18n'd repo + issues links (target=_blank, rel=noopener noreferrer) on all authenticated pages plus a compact equivalent on login. Final trellis-check verified AC1-AC10 (8 static criteria PASS, AC1/AC5 visual-only for human); typecheck + lint clean, en/zh dictionary parity 174=174. Working tree was already clean — code was merged via PR #9 (commit 534b1ca). Archived the task and recorded the journal.

## Session 10: On-demand camoufox browser lifecycle

**Date**: 2026-08-12
**Task**: On-demand camoufox browser lifecycle
**Branch**: `main`

### Summary

Replaced the camoufox sidecar's always-on Firefox (eager lifespan launch, ~823 MiB idle) with a lazy lifecycle: browser launches on the first fetch via single-flight double-checked locking on an asyncio.Lock, and is torn down after a configurable idle timeout (BROWSER_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS, default 300s, env CAMOUFOX_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS) by an idle-watcher task when no fetches are in-flight. /health now returns 200 {status:ok, browser:ready|absent} so the entrypoint boot gate passes without a resident browser. Anti-detect capability unchanged (same AsyncCamoufox headless linux config). Verified on the 1.95GB image: idle RAM 823->310 MiB (~500 MiB saved), browser absent at boot, lazy-launched on fetch, reaped after idle, single-flight confirmed across two concurrent fetches. Also added the NAS footprint-reduction backlog cataloging all Tier A-D candidate improvements for later pickup, and a performance.md spec note documenting the lazy lifecycle contract.

## Session 11: Throttle OpenCode Zen extraction (429 fix)

**Date**: 2026-08-13
**Task**: Throttle OpenCode Zen extraction (429 fix)
**Branch**: `main`

### Summary

Added a process-wide pLimit(1) + 2s min-interval + 429 exponential-backoff throttle around both generateText call sites in aiExtractPrice so free-tier Zen 429s stop failing scheduler ticks and add-product. Disabled the AI SDK default retries (maxRetries: 0 via generateTextThrottled) so they cannot burst the quota before our backoff runs. Introduced a thin ./ai-sdk re-export so unit tests can mock generateText (Vite externalizes packages/prices/node_modules/ai, making vi.mock('ai') a no-op). Added AI_EXTRACT_CONCURRENCY (default 1) and AI_EXTRACT_MIN_INTERVAL_MS (default 2000) env knobs in env.ts and .env.example. New tests/unit/ai-extract.test.ts asserts overlapping extracts serialize and a first-call 429 is retried then succeeds. vitest.config.ts moved resolve.alias to vite-level so @iris/utils etc. resolve in unit tests. Updated .trellis/spec/backend/ai-sdk-integration.md with a 7-section Scenario contract (signatures, env table, error matrix, good/base/bad, tests, wrong vs correct) plus the ai-sdk mockability gotcha, and added a cross-reference in performance.md. trellis-check passed all ACs; typecheck, lint, unit + sidecar-fetch tests green. Merged via PR #15.

## Session 12: Image loading pipeline improvements

**Date**: 2026-08-16
**Task**: Image loading pipeline improvements
**Branch**: `feat/image-loading-improvements`

### Summary

Hardened the server-side product image pipeline: added a shared retryWithBackoff helper used by both fetch-page and extract-image; added magic-byte validation (JPEG/PNG/GIF/WebP/AVIF) so unknown or mismatched content types return null instead of silently writing .jpg; bounded image-download concurrency with a module-level pLimit(3); dropped SVG from both downloader and serve endpoint to close the same-origin XSS vector. 18 new unit tests; lint/typecheck/build clean. Branched, committed, and pushed as feat/image-loading-improvements.

## Session 15: Retry transient 503 from AI provider

**Date**: 2026-08-20
**Task**: Retry transient 503 from AI provider
**Branch**: `main`

### Summary

Kogan product creates were rolling back with 'Service Unavailable' on the preloaded-html AI extraction path. Root cause: Zen's DeepSeek free tier intermittently returns HTTP 503 under load (confirmed by replaying the exact Kogan request — 200 OK, correct $469 NZD extraction). The retry predicate in ai-extract.ts only matched 429/'rate limit', so 503 threw on the first attempt with no backoff. Broadened isRetryableError to cover 502/503/504 (on status and statusCode), honor the AI SDK's isRetryable flag, and match 'service unavailable'/'bad gateway'/'gateway timeout' in messages. Renamed the warn log to 'Transient AI provider error, retrying' and added the error message. Added 503-retry and 400-no-retry unit tests. Did not touch the firecrawl task — this was an incidental bugfix.

## Session 16: Migrate price extraction to argus /v1/extract-price

**Date**: 2026-08-25
**Task**: Migrate price extraction to argus /v1/extract-price
**Branch**: `main`

### Summary

Removed iris's entire AI extraction layer: checkPrice now calls argus POST /v1/extract-price (JSON-LD first, LLM fallback in argus). New extract-price.ts client (bearer auth, pLimit(5), per-reason retry policy); images now derive from the returned JSON-LD Product node; deleted ai-extract/ai-sdk/fetch-page + AI_* env vars + ai-sdk deps; dropped global_settings.ai* x6 and user_settings.aiModelOverride via migration 0003 (validated on old-shape DB); trimmed settings/admin API+UI. QA pass fixes: positive-price guard (Number('')==0 regression), 120s timeout for AI-fallback worst case, 4xx fail-fast, dead-code removal, +5 tests. Debugged live Docker setup: ARGUS_BASE_URL must use host.docker.internal from inside containers (added compose host-gateway extra_hosts).

## Session 17: Batch of 10 low-priority fixes (single PR #45)

**Date**: 2026-08-26
**Task**: Batch of 10 low-priority fixes (single PR #45)
**Branch**: `main`

### Summary

Implemented all 10 low-priority tasks from .trellis/tasks/08-25-low-*/ and bundled them into one PR (#45, merged). Backend/infra: explicit return types in users.ts queries; dropped build-time ARGUS_API_TOKEN Docker placeholder; force-exit timeout on graceful shutdown (SHUTDOWN_FORCE_EXIT_MS); structured logging for SMTP send failures. API: allow clearing the Telegram bot token via null sentinel + Clear-token button; disambiguate check-now page-not-found message. Frontend: reset AddProductForm banner on submit; reset ProductDetailPage check-now state across :id changes; split ProductEditForm pause/resume pending from Save; make TelegramHelpTooltip touch + AT friendly (click/Enter/Space toggle, aria-describedby, Escape, outside-click). Added tests for the clear-token, pending-split, and tooltip behaviors. All 171 tests pass; typecheck and lint green across all packages.

## Session 18: fix(web): break infinite render loop in ProductDetailPage

**Date**: 2026-08-31
**Task**: fix(web): break infinite render loop in ProductDetailPage
**Branch**: `fix/product-detail-checknow-reset-loop`

### Summary

Diagnosed the 'Something went wrong' crash on the product details page (React error #185, infinite render loop) using the user's browser console stack trace. Root cause: commit 8941ff0 added useEffect(() => checkNow.reset(), [id, checkNow]) — MutationObserver.reset() always rebuilds a fresh result object and notifies subscribers, so the checkNow dep changed every render → effect → reset() → notify → … → React #185, caught by ErrorBoundary. Fix: depend on [id] only (checkNow.reset is a stable React Query method). Added a regression test using the real useMutation that asserts the fixed [id] deps stabilize (1 effect run) and the buggy [id, checkNow] deps loop (>10). jsdom does not throw #185 itself but the loop is fully observable via render/effect counts. Verified typecheck, lint, and full 173-test suite pass. Branch fix/product-detail-checknow-reset-loop pushed to origin.
