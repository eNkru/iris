 * is sent automatically (same-origin), so `protectedProcedure` resolves the
 * user on the server.
 *
 * `url` must be absolute: @orpc/client resolves it with `new URL()` and would
 * throw on a bare relative path. It is provided as a function so it is only
 * evaluated in the browser at call time (never during SSR).
